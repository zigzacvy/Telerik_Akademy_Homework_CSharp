//Write a program that encodes and decodes a string using given encryption key (cipher).
//The key consists of a sequence of characters. The encoding/decoding is done by performing
//XOR (exclusive or) operation over the first letter of the string with the first of the key,
//the second – with the second, etc. When the last key character is reached, the next is the first.
